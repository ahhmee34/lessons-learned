The lean launchpad approach is a very easy and effective way to get your software idea going. It emphasizes the use of a Minimum Viable Product, where startups must prioritize features and focus on what is most important first. The idea is to get feedback often and to reiterate often. By doing so, the startup can prioritize its features based on actual user feedback and gain insight into what is really important to the user in the end.
