In this section we will explore whether to start with a website or an app and look at the various considerations pertaining to each.

The first thing to realize when thinking about whether to build a site or an app is that it is no longer  a question of PC vs. mobile phone. Customers are now using iPads, tablets and wearable devices to access information. The increased uptake of these devices adds further complexity to the design of webpages and apps. 

When thinking about whether to build an app or a site, one should consider:

-	How soon should the product get to market – it would be faster to build a site that is mobile first/responsive then to build a separate mobile app and webpage. 

-	Simplicity – if you are still figuring out exactly how your product needs to work and what it needs to achieve - it is faster, cheaper and simpler to build either an app or a site first to test uptake and use rather than building both. As above, it is usually best to start with a responsive site.

-	How will the product be used – is this something that people are going to need to use mostly on the go, if so an app might be best, or is it something that you might need to spend some time looking at perhaps on a PC or tablet, in which case a site would be better.
