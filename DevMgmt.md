When managing developers, two important factors discussed in class are communucation / transparency as well as workflow management.
There are many tools to help support implementing both of these.  Some of them include: 
Trello: www.trello.com
Asana asana.com
Base Camp www.basecamp.com

There are many other potential tools, but based on discussion in class, Trello was the favorite.  This was due to its ease of use and 
ability to be easily adjusted.  In addition, trello enabled transparency of work, an easy way of communicating, in addition to clearly 
see the progress on a task as it transitition from to-do to deployment.  To support tools such as trello, daily standups where team members
can quickly say what they did yesterday, what they will do today, and if they are having any trouble helps create accountability and transparency
in the workplace.

Finally, it is important to break tasks down into individual features so that progress is made in shorter periods of time.  This is an example of 
how spring  could be used.  Breaking down development tasks into acheivable goals is important and enables the team to continue to make 
progress during each sprint duration.
