When managing developers, two important factors discussed in class are communucation / transparency as well as workflow management.
There are many tools to help support implementing both of these.  Some of them include: 
Trello: www.trello.com
Asana asana.com
Base Camp www.basecamp.com

There are many other potential tools, but based on discussion in class, Trello was the favorite.  This was due to its ease of use and ability to be easily adjusted.  In addition, trello enabled transparency of work, an easy way of communicating, in addition to clearly see the progress on a task as it transitition from to-do to deployment.  To support tools such as trello, daily standups where team members can quickly say what they did yesterday, what they will do today, and if they are having any trouble helps create accountability and transparency in the workplace.

When working with a developer it is very important to try to build a good relationship with him/her and gain his/her respect. The tool you choose to manage the workflow and communicate with can help to garner/lose respect - if you are up to date with the trending tools this will be appreciated by your developer and if not, you may lose some points!

Finally, it is important to break tasks down into individual features so that progress is made in shorter periods of time.  This is an example of  how spring  could be used.  Breaking down development tasks into acheivable goals is important and enables the team to continue to make progress during each sprint duration.
