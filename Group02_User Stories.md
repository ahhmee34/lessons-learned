  Utilizing user stories to clarify key features and benefits
  
User Stories help developers not only communicate but also move through the development process smoothly - from concept to ship.

  To create a User Story, we simply fill in the following blanks: 
      As a (role) →visitor (ex/buying shoes), competitor, returning customer, administrator
      I want (feature) → to see a list of shoes
      so that (benefit) → I can Buy/make a transaction
We then create a Backlog, in order to keep track of our requirements and - essentially - product to-do's.
What's ironic about this process is that we use seemingly simple, manual post-its in order to track our digitally savvy selves, and the products we are developing. However, at the same time, there are a number of savvy systs like Trello (see other page for more info) to digitize this process with a fun, delightful, and constructive user interface.

In other words, what a fun and sensible way to keep our development moving full speed ahead towards "ship," without hitting an iceberg.
